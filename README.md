# packlist

## An open-source packing list for Android

Why another packing-list... because existing are incomplete, out-of-date or expensive and any way not open-source.
Which is very disappointing when you wish to save your lists.

### Objectives in term of functionality : 
 * free
 * multi-language
 * activities based
 
### Objectives in term of coding :
 - multi-developer
 - very strict formatting rules
 - mandatory usage of quality plugins : checkstyle, findbugs
 - exhaustive javadoc
 - rich yet light logging (usage of https://github.com/JakeWharton/hugo)
 - large usage of plantuml
 - unit testing and Robotium testing

### BUT a place for experimentation of up-to-date technology
- groovy instead of Java
- material design
- android studio IDE 2 preview
- vector drawables, using asset studio
- in-app indexing

### Licence
Apache 2

### Devpt status
Basic functionality are still under development

### History of release
- 0.1 alpha 6th january 2015

### Coding conventions (WIP)
- fields should start with "m" (enforced in codeStyleSettings.xml)
- parameters should start with "par" (enforced in codeStyleSettings.xml)
