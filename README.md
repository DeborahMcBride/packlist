# packlist
##An open-source packing list for Android

Why another packing-list... because existing are incomplete, out-of-date or expensives and any way not open-source.
Which is very disappointing when you wish to save your lists.

### Objectives in term of functionnalities : 
 * free
 * multi-language
 * activities based
 
### Objectives in term of coding:
 - multi-developper
 - very strict formatting rules
 - exhaustive javadoc
 - large usage of plantuml

### BUT a place for experimentation of up-to-date technology
- groovy instead of Java
- material design
- android studio IDE 2 preview
- vector drawables

### Licence : Apache 2


-------------------

### Coding conventions
- fields should start ith "m" (enforced in codeStyleSettings.xml)
- parameters should start with "par" (enforced in codeStyleSettings.xml)
